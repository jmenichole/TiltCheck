# ðŸš¨ GitHub Domain Verification Issue - Solutions

## The Problem
GitHub is asking for DNS verification for `_gh-tiltcheck-e.584a0654c7f9.ngrok-free.app` because you're trying to set up a GitHub App. This won't work with ngrok's temporary domains.

## âœ… Solution 1: Use Repository Webhooks (Recommended)

Instead of GitHub Apps, use **Repository Webhooks** - no domain verification needed!

### Steps:
1. **Go to your repository** (not GitHub App settings)
2. **Settings â†’ Webhooks â†’ Add webhook**
3. **Configure these settings**:
   ```
   Payload URL: https://584a0654c7f9.ngrok-free.app/github/webhook
   Content type: application/json
   Secret: (leave empty for testing)
   SSL verification: Enable
   ```
4. **Select events**:
   - âœ… Push events
   - âœ… Pull request events
   - âœ… Issues events
   - âœ… Create events
   - âœ… Delete events

5. **Click "Add webhook"**

### Test it:
- Make a small commit to your repo
- Check Discord for Mischief Manager notifications

## âœ… Solution 2: Deploy to Free Hosting

If you want a permanent solution without ngrok:

### Railway (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Render
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Build command: `npm install` 
3. Start command: `node index.js`
4. Get permanent URL like: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

## Current Working Setup
- âœ… **Ngrok tunnel**: https://584a0654c7f9.ngrok-free.app
- âœ… **Webhook endpoint**: `/github/webhook`
- âœ… **Discord bot**: Running on port 3001
- âœ… **Ready for testing**: Use repository webhooks, not GitHub Apps

## Why This Happened
You likely clicked on "GitHub Apps" instead of "Webhooks" in repository settings. GitHub Apps require domain verification, but simple webhooks don't!

**Use Repository Webhooks = No domain verification needed** ðŸŽ‰
