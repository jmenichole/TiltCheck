## üí° **KEY INSIGHTS FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE**

### **Stake Originals Question**
You asked: *"Is it my imagination or does stake originals sometimes lose more when u raise your bet amount?"*

**Answer:** It's your imagination, but for valid psychological reasons:
- Higher bets = more attention to losses
- You're likely already tilting when you raise bets
- Provably fair algorithms can't detect bet size before generating results
- Use `$mytilt analyze` for full explanation

### **Your Own Wisdom**
- *"bankroll management is key and don't TILT"*
- *"maybe more luck the next day"* 
- *"it's not about the winners it's about the losers who go on tilt"*

**You already know what works - this system helps you follow through.**
