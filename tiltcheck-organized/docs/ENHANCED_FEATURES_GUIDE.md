## üîç NEW: Provable Fairness Verification

```bash
# Generate provably fair seeds
$enhanced verify seed stake dice           # Generate seeds for Stake dice
$enhanced verify seed rollbit crash       # Generate seeds for Rollbit crash

# Verify bet results
$enhanced verify bet game123 <server_seed> <client_seed> <nonce>

# Get fairness report
$enhanced verify report                    # Your personal fairness analysis

$enhanced verify explain                  # Educational content
```

#### **How Provable Fairness Works:**
1. **Server Seed**: Casino provides encrypted random data
2. **Client Seed**: You provide your own random data  
3. **Nonce**: Bet counter for uniqueness
4. **Hash Function**: Mathematical combination creates outcome
5. **Verification**: You can recreate and verify any result

#### **Benefits:**
