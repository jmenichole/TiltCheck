echo "🔧 TESTING PROCEDURE:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "1. Join each Discord server where bots are deployed"
echo "2. Test basic commands first (!help, !commands)"
echo "3. Test exclusive features for each bot"
echo "4. Verify disabled features show proper error messages"
echo "5. Test crypto wallet generation and verification"
echo "6. Test TiltCheck verification system"
echo "7. Report any errors or unexpected behavior"

echo ""
echo "✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "• TrapHouse: All features working (loans, tiltcheck, crypto, compliance, cards)"
echo "• JustTheTip: TiltCheck + Crypto + CollectClock + Cards (no loans/compliance)"
echo "• Degens: TiltCheck + Crypto + Cards (no loans/collectclock/compliance)"
echo "• All bots: Proper error messages for disabled features"
echo "• Crypto wallets: Real blockchain connectivity"
echo "• TiltCheck: Multi-platform verification working"

echo ""
echo "🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "------------------"
echo "• Bot not responding: Check if process is running"
echo "• Commands not working: Verify feature flags in .env"
echo "• RPC errors: Test blockchain connectivity"
echo "• Permission errors: Check Discord bot permissions"

echo ""
echo "📊 Current System Status:"
ps aux | grep "node main.js" | grep -v grep | awk '{print "• Process ID:", $2, "| Memory:", $6/1024 "MB"}'
echo "• Port 3002 (TrapHouse): $(lsof -i :3002 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 'Active' || echo 'Inactive')"
echo "• Port 3001 (JustTheTip): $(lsof -i :3001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo 'Active' || echo 'Inactive')"
