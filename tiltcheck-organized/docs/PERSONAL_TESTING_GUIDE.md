## 🎮 **How to Test with YOUR Gambling Habits**

### **Phase 1: Discord Bot Testing (5 minutes setup)**

1. **Get Discord Bot Token:**
   - Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Create new application → Bot → Copy token
   - Add bot to your test server with admin permissions

2. **Configure Your Settings:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.personal file:
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token
   DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_server_id
   USER_ID=your_discord_user_id
   
   # Your personal limits (ADJUST THESE TO YOUR HABITS):
   ALERT_LOSS_STREAK=3        # Alert after 3 losses
   ALERT_SESSION_TIME=60      # Alert after 1 hour  
   ALERT_STAKE_INCREASE=50    # Alert if bets increase by $50
   PERSONAL_BANKROLL_LIMIT=1000  # Your max daily limit
   ```

3. **Start Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm install  # Install dependencies
   npm start    # Start the bot
   ```

### **Phase 2: Track Real Gambling Session**

**In your Discord server, use these commands while actually gambling:**

```
🎯 Starting a real session:
!tiltcheck start "Stake US" 200
↳ Bot tracks: platform, starting bankroll, session start time

💰 Log each bet as you make it:
!tiltcheck bet 25 loss
!tiltcheck bet 50 win 125  
!tiltcheck bet 75 loss
↳ Bot analyzes: patterns, tilt levels, gives feedback

📊 Check status anytime:
!tiltcheck status
↳ Shows: current P&L, session time, risk level, recommendations

🏁 End session:
!tiltcheck end
↳ Generates: full report, grade, patterns detected, next session advice
```

### **Phase 3: Browser Extension Testing**

**While gambling on casino sites:**

1. Load extension: Chrome → Extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked → Select `public/` folder
2. Visit your casino site (Stake, etc.)  
3. Extension automatically detects gambling activity
4. Real-time overlay shows: session time, estimated losses, tilt warnings

## 🔥 **Advanced Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario A: Test Tilt Detection**
```bash
# Simulate a tilt session to see intervention system:
!tiltcheck start "Stake US" 500
!tiltcheck bet 50 loss     # Normal bet
!tiltcheck bet 100 loss    # Doubling (tilt indicator)
!tiltcheck bet 200 loss    # Doubling again (HIGH TILT ALERT)
!tiltcheck bet 400 win 800 # Big win while tilted
!tiltcheck status          # See tilt level and recommendations
```

### **Scenario B: Test Time-Based Alerts**  
```bash
# Start session and let it run for 1+ hours
!tiltcheck start "TrustDice" 300
# Bot will send periodic time warnings
# Test how you respond to "take a break" suggestions
```

### **Scenario C: Test Win/Loss Patterns**
```bash
# Track a real winning streak then losses:
!tiltcheck start "Stake US" 200
!tiltcheck bet 25 win 75   # Win streak
!tiltcheck bet 25 win 75   
!tiltcheck bet 25 win 75
!tiltcheck bet 100 loss    # Bigger bet after wins (common pattern)
!tiltcheck bet 200 loss    # Chase loss (tilt behavior)
# See how bot detects and responds to this pattern
```
