# 🔧 TiltCheck Deployment Fix - RESOLVED!

## **✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Port Binding Error**

### **Problem:**
```
No open ports detected, continuing to scan...
Port scan timeout reached, no open ports detected.
```

### **Root Cause:**
Discord bots don't need to expose HTTP ports - they connect to Discord's WebSocket API. Render was expecting the bot to bind to a port because it was configured as a "web" service.

### **Solution Applied:**
Changed Discord bot service type from `web` to `worker` in `render.yaml`.

## **🚀 UPDATED DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION**

### **render.yaml (FIXED):**
```yaml
services:
  # TiltCheck Web Application
  - type: web
    name: tiltcheck-web
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm install --only=production --legacy-peer-deps --no-optional
    startCommand: node server.js

  # TiltCheck Discord Bot (Background Worker)
  - type: worker  # ← FIXED: Changed from "web" to "worker"
    name: tiltcheck-discord-bot
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm install --only=production --legacy-peer-deps --no-optional
    startCommand: node bot.js --mode integrated
    envVars:
      - key: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
        sync: false
      - key: SOLANA_RPC_URL
        value: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
      - key: SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY
        sync: false
      - key: JWT_SECRET
        sync: false
      - key: ENCRYPTION_KEY
        sync: false
```
