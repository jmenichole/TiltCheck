## üé• Creating Your Own Demo

If you want to create a demo video yourself, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Screen recording software (OBS Studio, QuickTime, etc.)
- Working installation of TiltCheck Agent
- Microphone for voiceover (optional but recommended)

### Recording Steps

1. **Prepare Your Environment**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/TiltCheck
   # Ensure you have clean terminal output
   clear
   ```

2. **Start Recording**
   - Open your screen recording software
   - Start recording your terminal and/or IDE

3. **Follow the Script**
   ```bash
   # 1. Show the repository
   ls -la
   cat README_AGENT.md  # Show first few lines
   
   # 2. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # 3. Show the agent code briefly
   cat agent.py | head -50
   
   # 4. Run the agent
   python agent.py
   
   # Let it run for 1-2 minutes to show the periodic checks
   # The demo data will trigger both alerts
   
   # 5. Press Ctrl+C to stop
   ```

4. **Add Voiceover** (recommended)
   - Explain what's happening at each step
   - Highlight the alert messages
   - Discuss the technical implementation
   - Mention real-world impact

5. **Edit and Export**
   - Trim to 3-5 minutes
   - Add title slides if desired
   - Export in MP4 format (1080p recommended)

### Demo Script Outline

```markdown
[SLIDE: TiltCheck Agent - ASI Alliance Hackathon]

"Hi, I'm demonstrating the TiltCheck Agent, an intelligent agent built 
with Fetch.ai's uAgents framework for the ASI Alliance Hackathon."

[SHOW: Terminal with repository]

"TiltCheck uses AI agents to detect gambling tilt - a state where players 
make poor decisions due to emotional frustration. Let's see it in action."

[SHOW: Installation]

"First, we install the required dependencies - the uAgents framework 
and pandas for data processing."

[SHOW: Starting the agent]

"Now let's start the agent. Notice it generates a unique address and 
registers itself on the testnet."

[SHOW: Agent running]

"The agent monitors gambling session data every 30 seconds. Here we see 
it detecting rapid spinning - 55 spins in just 5 minutes."

[HIGHLIGHT: Alert message]

"The agent sends a plain English alert through the ASI Chat Protocol: 
'You've been spinning too fast. Take a break.'"

[SHOW: Second alert]

"And here's another alert - the player's balance dropped 70% in 10 minutes. 
The agent recommends vaulting some winnings."

[SHOW: Code briefly]

"Under the hood, the agent uses configurable thresholds and time windows 
to detect these patterns. All messages use the ASI Chat Protocol for 
agent-to-agent communication."

[SHOW: Agentverse registration]

"The agent can be registered on Agentverse and discovered through ASI:One, 
making it part of the broader ASI Alliance ecosystem."

[CLOSING SLIDE]

"TiltCheck Agent promotes responsible gaming through intelligent monitoring 
and timely interventions. This is real-world AI for social good. 
Thank you!"
```

## üé¨ Alternative: Live Demo

If you prefer a live demonstration:

1. **Run the demo script**:
   ```bash
   python demo_agent.py
   ```
   This runs the detection algorithms without needing the uAgents framework.

2. **Show the output**:
   - Session statistics
   - Tilt detection results
   - Alert messages and details

3. **Explain the integration**:
   - How the full agent.py adds uAgents framework
   - ASI Chat Protocol messaging
   - Agentverse discoverability
